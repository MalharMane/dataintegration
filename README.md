# Piston Inspection and Measurement Tool

![Project Image](./images/project-image.png)

## Overview

The Piston Inspection and Measurement Tool is a web application developed in React.js for conducting detailed inspections and measurements of pistons used in internal combustion engines. This tool aids mechanics and engineers in ensuring precise dimensions and tolerances of pistons, crucial for optimal engine performance and longevity.

## Features

- **Measurement Charts:** Visual representation of piston measurements including diameter at skirt, top, and ring grooves.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs for analyzing measurement trends and deviations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and input of measurement data.
- **Export Functionality:** Capability to export measurement reports and charts for documentation purposes.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/piston-inspection-tool.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd piston-inspection-tool
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
